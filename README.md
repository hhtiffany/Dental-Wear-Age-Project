# Dental Wear and Age Project
The Dental Wear and Age project aims to use the Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to help client select the best subset for the linear model that illustrates the relationship between teeth wear (28 teeth) and age.

There is no data updated due to the privacy.

The LOOCV.Rmd shows the code for pursuing the LOOCV result for the best subsects with different number of variables.
The Report-Tree.Rmd gives the code for regression tree and boosting.
The Tree-based Method.Rmd gives the code for additional bagging and random forest method.
